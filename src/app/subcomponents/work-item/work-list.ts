So, instead of buying those softwares, I wanted to try making one myself since I'm a proud programmer. Thus, using my knowledge of web programming, I created this Voucher Printing Webapp for my dad's shop. It's not an amazing project since it depends on Chrome to run but it will show my dedication and competitive mindset in technology. I felt good being able to help my dad using the technologies I've learnt.",

So it basically allows user to write HTML without coding knowledge so people without coding knowledge could help my friend to write his HTML codes.",
